<!-- **Documentation**: TODO -->

## Motivation

By leveraging our quantum-enhanced end-to-end solution for cost-efficient sensor placement and rapid fault and vulnerability localization, qathir enables the robust and efficient use of the increasingly complex water distribution networks of tomorrow.

Please check out our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRwLkgCpkB5gSSmqP016QIRihLcBpB13e0bkr3gk_eS7b2I5p0nWXYEDG7E5tB5AnMWsFPpO7QcXLCa/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) from NYUAD Hack 2023 to learn more about this project. 

## Installation

*Conda users, please make sure to `conda install pip` before running any pip installation if you want to install `qathir` into your conda environment.*

`qathir` may soon be published on PyPI. Once it is, simply run the following code to install the package:

```bash
pip install qathir
```
If you also want to download the dependencies needed to run optional tutorials, please use `pip install qathir[dev]` or `pip install 'qathir[dev]'` (for `zsh` users).


To check if the installation was successful, run:

```bash
python -c "import qathir"
```

This should execute silently if installation was successful.

## Building from source

To build `qathir` from source, pip install using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:qcnet/NYUAD-2023.git qathir
cd team-13/qathir
pip install --upgrade .
```

If you also want to download the dependencies needed to run optional tutorials, please use `pip install --upgrade .[dev]` or `pip install --upgrade '.[dev]'` (for `zsh` users).

#### Installation for Devs

If you intend to contribute to this project, please install `qathir` in editable mode as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:qcnet/NYUAD-2023.git qathir
cd team-13/qathir
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Please use `pip install -e '.[dev]'` if you are a `zsh` user.

Installing the package in the usual non-editable mode would require a developer to upgrade their pip installation (i.e. run `pip install --upgrade .`) every time they update the package source code.

## Documentation

<!-- Documentation should be -->
